    "interpretations": {
      "None or minimal depression": "Your responses suggest very few depressive symptoms. This means that, while moments of sadness or tiredness may occasionally appear, they do not interfere with your daily life. Maintaining healthy routines, meaningful social connections, and giving yourself time to recharge are all important to continue protecting your well-being. You can also strengthen your balance by listening to Spectramentis audios, which are designed to help you cultivate calmness and stay connected with your inner resources.",
      "Mild depression": "You may notice occasional sadness, low energy, or a lack of interest in activities you usually enjoy. These moments are common, but it is important to pay attention to how they evolve. Practicing self-care, taking time to rest, and finding space for activities that bring you comfort can make a difference. Including mindfulness and guided relaxation in your routine can help lighten the weight of these feelings. Listening to Spectramentis audios may provide you with gentle support and a simple way to reconnect with yourself.",
      "Moderate depression": "Depressive symptoms are becoming more frequent and may begin to affect how you feel and how you manage daily activities. This is a signal that you may benefit from extra care and support. Reaching out to a health professional is an important step to better understand what is happening and to find strategies that fit your needs. Alongside professional help, dedicating time to mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation with Spectramentis audios can give you moments of relief and a sense of renewed energy.",
      "Moderately severe depression": "Persistent depressive symptoms are likely affecting several areas of your life, including your mood, motivation, and relationships. Living with this level of emotional weight can be very challenging, and it is important to take this seriously. Professional assessment and support are strongly recommended, as they can provide you with the guidance and resources you need. At the same time, practicing small daily rituals of self-care, such as listening to calming Spectramentis audios, may help you find brief but meaningful moments of peace in your day.",
      "Severe depression": "Severe depressive symptoms can feel overwhelming and may deeply affect your life, increasing the risk of self-harm. If you are experiencing this, it is crucial to seek immediate professional help. You do not need to go through this alone. Talking to a doctor or a mental health professional can give you the support and safety you need. While waiting for help or in moments of calm, you may also find comfort in listening to Spectramentis audios, which are created to offer a gentle space for grounding and soothing. Remember that reaching out is a sign of strength and the first step toward recovery."
