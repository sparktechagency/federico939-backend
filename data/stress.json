This does not mean that moments of tension will never arise, but it shows that you already have effective coping strategies that help you maintain your well-being. Continue nurturing these habits and give yourself space to recharge whenever you need it. Listening to the relaxation and mindfulness audios from SpectraMentis can be a simple way to reinforce your inner calm and strengthen your ability to handle future challenges with resilience.",
